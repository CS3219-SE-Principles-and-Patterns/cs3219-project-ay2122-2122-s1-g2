# Overview
It is difficult to learn a new language. Even with the help of beginner modules in NUS, students tend to struggle while learning a new language. There is not only the need to understand and familiarise yourself with many new vocabulary words but also to understand how the language is structured. 

Due to the overwhelming breadth of content, it is challenging for learners to organise their learning through methods such as traditional rote memorisation techniques. With the advent of technology, tools such as online flashcards have become commonplace to help reduce the difficulty in memorising vocabulary or learning grammar. There is no consolidated platform which allows for learners to have quick access to sample sentences along with vocabulary words. Often, learning a new language is an individual and arduous pursuit, and we hope to leverage the social aspects of online sharing platforms to help in this fruitful endeavour.

Our website builds on this pain point of people trying to learn new languages by providing a platform for people to create flashcards as well as to play vocabulary games against each other. LanguageLearners allows users to create flashcards in Korean/Japanese and play vocabulary games against other users of a similar rating. Our project, in essence, is built around making the process of learning a new language less tedious and more enjoyable for users.
